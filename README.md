## Background

The goals for this repository are:

1. To document my journey learning sass, by building a well crafted portfolio.
2. Show the implementation of sass in a real project.
3. Learing how to write good READMEs - This Readme is fully "standard-readme" compliant.

## Install

This project uses sass. Go check it out if you don't have it locally installed yet.
```
$ npm install --global sass
```
When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:
```
sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
```
First install Sass using one of the options below, then run sass --version to be sure it installed correctly. You can also run sass --help for more information about the command-line interface.

## Usage

This is only a documentation project for educational purpose.
