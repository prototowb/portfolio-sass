## Background

The goals for this repository are:

1. To document my journey learning sass by building a well crafted portfolio.
2. Show the implementation of sass in a real project.
3. Showcase the usage of the html picture Tag and handling the responsivenss of images (the first one in the gallery has multiple sources for different resolutions). 
4. Learing how to write good READMEs - This Readme is fully "standard-readme" compliant.

## Install

This project uses [sass](https://sass-lang.com). Go check it out if you don't have it locally installed yet.
```
$ npm install --global sass
```
When you install Sass on the command line, you'll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass and .scss files to .css files. For example:
```
sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
```
You can also run sass --help for more information about the command-line interface.

## Usage

This is only a documentation project for educational purpose.
